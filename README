timefilter
==========

This script reads stdin and filters it thought to stdout based on the time.
This enables a very noisy output to be sampled in small chunks.

An example of where this is useful - analysing the strace output of a long
running process. Rather than storing the full strace output this script allows
you to capture a few second long intervals at regular intervals.

INSTALLATION

For the time being there is no install - this is a single script.
